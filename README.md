# AgeOfWargroove
A mod for Wargroove

Change the gameplay to be more like Age of Empires or Warcraft. In a nutshell, HQ produces villagers, villagers construct buildings and mine gold. Rest of the gameplay is the same as before

## Changes:
1. Can no longer reinforce from buildings
1. Buildings no longer regenerate
1. Buildings will be destroyed when HP reaches 0
1. Buildings no longer generate gold
1. HQ can recruit villagers
1. Villagers can build buildings
1. New building "Gold"
1. New building "Gold Camp" that can be build on top of "Gold"
1. Villagers can garrison Gold Camp to gather gold (50 gold per villagers per turn, up to 5 villagers per camp)
1. Each gold will have a value of 5000, and for every 50 gold mined from the gold pile, gold pile's hp will decrease by 1 (so a gold pile with 10 hp can generated 500 gold. Which is 5 villagers in the gold camp for 2 turns or 1 villager in the gold camp for 10 turns)

## TODO:
1. Villagers can repair buildings
1. 3 Different Tech Levels (e.g. dragon can only be recruited at tech level 3)
1. Building foundations so that it takes multiple "build" command to finish building a building (either 1 villager with multiple turns or multiple villagers on a single turn)
1. Population cap (Atm villages just act like walls. I think i'm gonna use them to determine how many units the player can recruit)
1. Better sprites (Terrible ms paint art for new buildings atm)
1. Fix description strings
1. AI
