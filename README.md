# AgeOfWargroove
A mod for Wargroove

Change the gameplay to be more like Age of Empires or Warcraft. In a nutshell, HQ produces villagers, villagers construct buildings and mine gold. Rest of the gameplay is the same as before

## Changes:
1. Can no longer reinforce from buildings
1. Mage heals cost no gold
1. Buildings no longer regenerate
1. Villagers can repair buildings
1. Buildings will be destroyed when HP reaches 0
1. Buildings no longer generate gold
1. HQ can recruit villagers
1. Villagers can build buildings
1. New building "Gold"
1. New building "Gold Camp" that can be build on top of "Gold"
1. Villagers can garrison Gold Camp to gather gold (50 gold per villagers per turn, up to 5 villagers per camp)
1. Each gold will have a value of 2500, and for every 50 gold mined from the gold pile, gold pile's hp will decrease by 2 (so a gold pile with 10 hp can be mined for 250 gold. Which is 5 villagers in the gold camp for 1 turns or 1 villager in the gold camp for 5 turns)
1. 3 Different Tech Levels (e.g. dragon can only be recruited at tech level 3)
1. Population cap (HQ increases population cap by 8, village and water village increase it by 4. You cannot recruit new units when you are population capped. You can check your max population and current population by hovering over HQ or any of the villages. max population is 100)

## TODO:
1. Building foundations so that it takes multiple "build" command to finish building a building (either 1 villager with multiple turns or multiple villagers on a single turn)
1. Unit upkeep
1. Better sprites (Terrible ms paint art for new buildings atm)
1. Fix description strings
1. AI
1. Buf fixes
