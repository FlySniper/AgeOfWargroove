# AgeOfWargroove
A mod for Wargroove

Change the gameplay to be more like Age of Empires or Warcraft. In a nutshell, HQ produces villagers, villagers construct buildings and mine gold. Rest of the gameplay is the same as before

Changes:
-Can no longer reinforce from buildings
-Buildings no longer regenerate
-Buildings will be destroyed when HP reaches 0
-Buildings no longer generate gold
-HQ can recruit villagers
-Villagers can build buildings
-New building "Gold"
-New building "Gold Camp" that can be build on top of "Gold"
-Villagers can garrison Gold Camp to gather gold (50 gold per villagers per turn, up to 5 villagers per camp)
-Each gold will have a value of 5000, and for every 50 gold mined from the gold pile, gold pile's hp will decrease by 1 (so a gold pile with 10 hp can generated 500 gold. Which is 5 villagers in the gold camp for 2 turns or 1 villager in the gold camp for 10 turns)

TODO:
-Villagers can repair buildings
-3 Different Tech Levels (e.g. dragon can only be recruited at tech level 3)
-Building foundations so that it takes multiple "build" command to finish building a building (either 1 villager with multiple turns or multiple villagers on a single turn)
-Population cap (Atm villages just act like walls. I think i'm gonna use them to determine how many units the player can recruit)
-Better sprites (Terrible ms paint art for new buildings atm)
-Fix description strings
-AI
